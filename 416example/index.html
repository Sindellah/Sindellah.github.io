	<h1>The Hits Heard Round the World:<br> The Washington Nationals win it all</h1>

	<p>The Washington Nationals brought the World Series trophy back to the nation's capital for the first time since 1924. The Washington Nationals should always be remembered for beating Goliath and winning the National League Championship Series against the New York Yankees.</p>

	<p>The Washington Nationals are champions after beating the Houston Astros in a well-played Game 7 of the 2019 World Series and clinched the title at Minute Maid Park in Houston. The Nationals made the biggest upheaval in National League Championship Series history, winning the World Series for the first time since 1924.</p>

	<p>Washington started the year 19-31, but they turned it around and beat the oldest team in baseball in Game 7 of the 2019 World Series against the Houston Astros. The Nationals' victory continues the streak in which visiting teams have won every game in the series since the New York Yankees in 1999.</p>

	<p>After losing star outfielder Bryce Harper in the winter, few gave Washington much hope, but the Nats shed a four-month-long tear just to win a wildcard playoff spot. In three days, he can terminate his contract, which pays him $100 million over four years and makes him a free agent. The Nats won their first World Series title in franchise history and their second in three years.</p>

	<p>After defeating the Milwaukee Brewers, knocking out the Los Angeles Dodgers and defeating the St. Louis Cardinals in the playoffs, the Nationals were big underdogs in the fall classics. A wild World Series full of unexpected moments and incredible comebacks has come to an end. The Washington Nationals are the new MLB champions and celebrate winning the 2019 World Series after beating the Houston Astros 3-2 at AT & T Park in Arlington, Texas, Wednesday, October 3, 2019. </p>

	<p>The Nationals defeated the Houston Astros 3-2 to win Game 7, ending the 2019 World Series and winning their first title in franchise history.</p>

	<p>The victory caps a thrilling contest in which the Nats stole three games from the heavily favored Astros in Houston and also won the World Series for the first time in franchise history. The Houston Astros want nothing more than to go with an ace on the mound and a chance to win the championship in Game 6 of the World Series. With a win tonight, the Astros will become only the fifth team in MLB history to recover from an 0-2 deficit to win a series and win the first championship in Major League Baseball history.</p>

	<p>The Astros beat Washington's Stephen Strasburg, who threw six innings of two-run ball in Game 2 before the Nationals won 12-3. Verlander got the loss, allowing four runs on seven hits in six innings, but the Astros need to pick up a win tonight as they travel to Washington for Game 6.</p>

	<p>The Washington Nationals defeated Justin Verlander 12-3 in Game 6 of the World Series against the Houston Astros. After winning their second consecutive American League Championship Series title, the Houston Astros could close Game 7 in Washington tonight with a victory and secure their third consecutive National League championship.</p>

	<p>So the series heads to a decisive Game 7, where the winner will win baseball glory and take home the third consecutive National League Championship Series title. The Washington Nationals are world champions for the first time since the Washington Senators in 1924 after a 12-3 victory over the Houston Astros in Game 6 of the 2017 World Series in Washington, D.C. This is the second time in franchise history that a team has been based in D.C., and the third time the franchise has won a championship in its home town.</p>

	<p>National team fans went wild when their team finished its unlikely title fight against Houston in Washington, D.C., on Oct.</p>

	<p>No MLB team has ever won a road game to win the World Series, and that's a beautiful thing in sports. The Nationals shouldn't have won, but they did - and it's the first time in the history of the game that they've won.</p>

	<p>That trend was broken Wednesday night when the Washington Nationals completed a remarkable comeback with a 3-2 victory over the Houston Astros in Game 7 of the World Series, beating Houston to win their first World Series title in franchise history. The series ended 3-3, and there was a challenge for the Washington Nationals on Thursday (AEST), who go into Game 7 against the Astros themselves.</p>

	<p>Howie Kendrick and Anthony Rendon hit home runs and the Nationals rallied from two runs down in the seventh inning of Game 7 of the winner-take-all World Series to claim the best - by - seven, 4 - 3. The pendulum swung in Houston's favor in Game 6, this time Kendrick Harris hit, and it stayed there for the rest of Wednesday night as the Nationals became the fourth team in a row to win a Game 7 on the road and the first since the New York Yankees in 2004.
